Implementation for Opensplice of the proposed OMG DDS Java
Application Programming Interface (API)
This is an interim solution until a native implementation is provided by
Prismtech. This implementation is not complete. It will also not provide
any performance improvements over the original DCPS API since DCPS is
used as the underlying mechanism. Also since this implementation wraps 
around the native DCPS interface, it requires generated DCPS code for
all topics used in an application.

This software is provided without any warranty for its correct functioning, or
completeness. It should not be used in production code.

Due to my limited knowledge of the java language I was not able to create
compilable java code for a very specific feature of the EntityQos.
As a result I have modified the original file to remove this feature and
have included that file in this distribution. The original license (Apache) is
applicable to this single file.
