Implementation for Opensplice of the proposed OMG DDS Java
Application Programming Interface (API)
This is an interim solution until a native implementation is provided by
Prismtech. This implementation is not complete. It will also not provide
any performance improvements over the original DCPS API since DCPS is
used as the underlying mechanism. Also since this implementation wraps 
around the native DCPS interface, it requires generated DCPS code for
all topics used in an application.

This software is provided without any warranty for its correct functioning, or
completeness. It should not be used in production code.
